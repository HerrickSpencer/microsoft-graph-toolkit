# Vue.js Sample for MGT

This sample shows how to incorporate the Microsoft Graph Toolkit into a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) app.

The sample was initially created with the [vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/) tool for Typescript and dart-sass.

## Setting up Vue for MGT

1. Install MGT with `npm install @microsoft/mgt`
2. In your `App.vue` or other Vue components, add an import with the components you want to use E.g. `import { MgtMsalProvider, MgtLogin, MgtAgenda } from '@microsoft/mgt';`.
3. Now you can use those MGT components in your Vue component!
